      <h2 class="heading-1">Overlook Resort</h2>
      <div class="body">
        During French rule, Kep was Cambodia’s premier seaside destination,
        widely known as “the St. Tropez of South-East Asia.” Here Overlook, we
        have worked with French architect Francoise Lavielle to restore and
        remodel these stunning colonial villas. They are now the centrepiece of
        an impeccably designed coastal resort which features plush rooms, an
        infinity pool overlooking the Gulf of Thailand, world-class cuisine, and
        much more. We treat our guests to a combination of privacy and
        personalized service, and enable them to discover the splendours of
        Cambodia and its wonderful people. We achieve all this while being the
        most environmentally aware and socially conscious hotel in all of
        Cambodia.
