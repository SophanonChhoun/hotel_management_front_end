        <div class="body">
          Known at the turn of the century as ‘Kep Sur Mer’ – an exclusive
          seaside getaway for the colonial French elite – in the 1950s, during
          the Golden Age of Cambodia, Kep was a popular holiday and residential
          destination for wealthy Khmers. The Overlook structures are the
          creations of the movement led by iconic Cambodian architect Van
          Molyvan, a protege of the famous Le Corbusier (French architect). Our
          iconic Blue Villa once belonged to the governor of Kep; the entrance
          and reception building was owned by a relative of the King; and the
          red summer house was owned by the Head of Customs. Francoise Lavielle,
          a French architect living in Phnom Penh, has taken the lead in
          restoring the villas to their original architectural grandeur.

      <div class="body">
        In Khmer, Overlook means a rainbow encircling the sun. In Buddhism, this
        rainbow is the halo around Buddha’s head. Keeping this symbolism in
        mind, Overlook was developed as an exclusive retreat to protect and
        shelter its visitors and offer them a home away from home.

        With a connection to our region, our unique barefoot luxury concept
        encapsulates the history and culture of Kep. Elegant lines, natural
        materials, and subtle earthy hues combine perfectly to create a sense of
        continuity with the surrounding gardens, swaying palm trees, and open
        views of the sea. Our spacious rooms have all been tastefully furnished
        with local antiques and artefacts that reflect modern Khmer design and
        architecture.

      <div class="body">
        A driving force behind the clean lines and minimalist style of Overlook
        is adopted from the ancient Japanese philosophy of Wabi Sabi, which
        places importance on simplicity & understated elegance. Overlook was
        developed as an exclusive retreat to protect and shelter its visitors
        and offer them a home away from home, with a signature blend of privacy
        and personalized service. A driving force behind Overlook is to provide
        you with private time on your own. We have taken care to create spaces
        specially made for reflection and rejuvenation.
